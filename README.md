# NEURAL AIDED AUDITORY SYSTEM FOR AUTONOMOUS FOOD ORDERING BY SIGHTLESS

This Android application is developed using **Flutter** and is designed to assist visually impaired individuals in independently ordering food using a **voice-guided interface**. 

The application focuses on accessibility, convenience, and inclusivity in the food ordering process. The user journey begins with **registration and login**, followed by a **home page displaying restaurant options**. The menu for each restaurant is navigated through **voice prompts**.

Users can select their desired menu item by **stating the corresponding number**, and the system then allows them to **place an order**. Voice feedback is provided at each step, including **order preparation status** and **delivery tracking**.

The voice-enabled interface eliminates the need for visual input, empowering sightless users to independently:

- Browse restaurant menus
- Place orders
- Receive updates on order preparation and delivery

By integrating these features, the system enhances **accessibility, independence, and convenience**, resulting in a more inclusive food ordering experience.
